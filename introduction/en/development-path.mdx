The ArtStar project develops in four phases: laying foundations, connecting the world, stable iteration, and RWA asset autonomy. Each phase focuses on advancing the overall vision of a global digital asset center for cultural relics and artworks. Below are the objectives and overview of each phase.

## Phase 1 Laying Foundations (Discovery and Validation)

Focus: establish the community economic model, inject the first batch of USD 10 million in cultural relics and artworks, conduct RWA issuance, and build the initial community.

### Establish the Community Economic Model

Bring together global leaders in cultural relics and art, technology experts, finance professionals, and community leaders to form the initial professional team, establishing the RWA community economic model and operating standards for cultural relics and artworks.

### Asset Staking

Provide the first batch of physical cultural relics and artworks valued at over USD 10 million. Form an RWA Asset Oversight Committee to work with authoritative third-party appraisal institutions to verify authenticity and assess value of physical assets, ensuring value and provenance before tokenization.

{/* ### ArtStar TOKEN 的发行

Mint and issue 1 billion ART TOKEN. Tokens will be available via subscription on the official website, offline community participation, DeFi, or public auction on mainstream exchanges.

### 平台基础设施设置

In the initial phase, ArtStar mints Art TOKEN on mainstream public chains. After release, the ArtStar chain main-chain blockchain network will be developed, and Layer-2 infrastructure will be built. */}

### Community Participation

Form a DAO community, establish voting and decision-making mechanisms, and implement diverse community-participation economic activities.

## Phase 2 Connecting the World (Industrial Ecosystem)

Focus: cross-chain bridge circulation of main-chain assets, RWA asset expansion, and Layer-2 network and ecosystem construction.

{/* ### 主链上线运行

The ArtStar main-chain blockchain network goes live, ensuring efficient cross-chain bridge circulation of ArtStar assets between mainstream public chains and the main chain. */}

### RWA Asset Expansion

Establish deep partnerships with museums, private collections, and auction houses. Through DAO governance, review and admit high-quality, large-scale, and valuable RWA assets onto the platform to expand ArtStar’s asset scale.

### Layer-2 Network and Ecosystem Construction

Build a Layer-2 network. Open the technical architecture to support innovative activities such as asset staking, lending, and financial derivatives; support multi-scenario ecosystem applications including lending of cultural relics and artworks, physical derivatives, immersive metaverse experiences, and auctions; and promote investor returns and community contributions.

## Phase 3 Stable Iteration

### Engage Capital for Steady Expansion

Partner with financial institutions, insurance institutions, and international capital to steadily expand the asset pool.

### Upgrade ArtStar Infrastructure

Upgrade ArtStar Layer-1 and Layer-2, coordinate with stablecoin main-chain network technology and business logic, and optimize DAO decision-making mechanisms.

## Phase 4 Ecosystem Integration and Full Community Autonomy

Focus: complete autonomy of the ArtStar ecosystem.

### Full Ecosystem Autonomy

Achieve 100% free circulation of ArtStar with no definitive maximum beneficiary. Realize full autonomy across the main-chain network, economic ecosystem, and community.
