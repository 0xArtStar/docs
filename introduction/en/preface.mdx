The ArtStar RWA (Real-World Assets) project is launched by Hangzhou Chong’er Culture Co., Ltd. Leveraging its own physical assets of cultural relics and artworks, and aligning with Web3 regulatory frameworks in regions such as Hong Kong, ArtStar is committed to building a secure, transparent, and decentralized global value platform for encrypted digital assets of cultural relics and artworks. The project aims to fully activate the financial attributes and liquidity of artworks by integrating RWA, blockchain technology, DAO governance, and cryptocurrency, creating an innovative asset management ecosystem for the art world and truly achieving “RWA revitalizes art, liquidity unlocks value.”

A vital foundation of the project was laid by Mr. Li Haibo, a seasoned expert in art finance. He formed the project team in 2020 and brings over 17 years of deep experience in the field. As one of the key promoters of the financialization of Chinese artworks, Mr. Li participated in the founding of the Tianjin Cultural Exchange and the Shenzhen Cultural Exchange, with rich practical industry experience and resource integration capability. Under his leadership, the team has built an artwork asset pool with a scale in the tens of billions and established strategic partnerships with multiple internationally renowned universities and institutions, forming a top-tier team of experts in art authentication and financialization.

Driven by blockchain technology at its core, ArtStar is committed to promoting the digital transformation of the art investment and collection industry, empowering and reshaping the art finance ecosystem through technology, and striving to become a benchmark in the field. ArtStar represents a new paradigm of digital currency, achieving sustained operation of art financial value in a decentralized manner, enabling global holders and investors of art assets to participate in governance and gain abundant financial and ecosystem service returns.

## Market Size and Trends

As of 2025, the number of museums worldwide exceeds 55,000, with over 4,000 private museums, all housing vast collections of cultural relics and artworks. For example, the Musée du Louvre in Paris holds approximately 380,000 items, while the British Museum’s collection exceeds 8 million items.

According to the global art market report jointly released by Art Basel and UBS, the total value of global art and collectible assets is estimated at around USD 1.7 trillion. Driven by asset allocation needs, the number of global high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) surpassed 22 million in 2022. Since 2020, annual global transaction volumes have stabilized around USD 65 billion. Through the innovative path of digital assetization, more investors are expected to participate, increasing the scale and liquidity of transactions for cultural relics and art assets. Based on participation from the current 500 million crypto investors, the number of actual investors in cultural relics and artworks is projected to grow by 20x, with asset transaction scale surpassing USD 10 trillion.

Data for 2018–2022 is primarily based on the auction segment of the Art Basel & UBS reports, reflecting sharp fluctuations before and after the pandemic.

Data for 2023–2024 comes from the Art Basel 2025 report, showing auction sales retreating from their peaks.

Data for 2025 represents actual values for the first half of the year (USD 3.98 billion collectively for Christie’s, Sotheby’s, and Phillips). The full-year forecast is based on current trends and historical shares (auctions typically account for 30–40% of the annual total market).

## Main Objectives

### Build a Global RWA Digital Asset Platform for Cultural Relics and Artworks

Build a secure, global RWA Launchpad platform for cultural relics and artworks, achieving digital assetization and compliant operational management via cross-chain networks on mainstream public blockchains.

### DAO Community Governance

Use a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to oversee physical assets (custodied by authoritative third parties), make decisions, and grant stakeholders voting rights and the ability to influence project direction. Enable global participation and governance so museums, private collections, investors, and institutions can vote on key decisions and receive rewards. The DAO governance model ensures all participants have the opportunity to impact operations and share financial outcomes.

### Regulatory Compliance

Ensure the platform adheres to the legal compliance frameworks of Hong Kong and other relevant jurisdictions where the platform operates.
