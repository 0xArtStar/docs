ArtStar will rely on the infrastructure of mature mainstream public chains and cross-chain technology to conduct minting and trading management of asset tokens. This approach helps ArtStar launch quickly, safeguard the security and privacy of sensitive asset data, and ensure transaction transparency. The following summarizes the key technical elements:

## Smart Contracts

ArtStar will use smart contracts to manage minting, trading, and staking of asset tokens. Smart contracts can automatically execute core processes such as asset staking, token issuance, and asset transfer.

These smart contracts will undergo rigorous testing and auditing by professional third-party security organizations to ensure their security and correctness. In addition, adopting multi-signature contracts can add an extra layer of protection for high-value transactions.

## Blockchain Infrastructure

The ARTChain main-chain platform will build Layer-1 infrastructure and open Layer-2 technical ecosystem applications. Validators in the network will be selected based on their holdings and contributions in the platform’s native ArtStar TOKEN, incentivizing participants to act honestly.

- **ARTChain Main Chain Layer-1 Network Facilities**
  - Node operator network: ensure security and validate the network
  - Block producer network
  - The blockchain ledger itself and transaction history
  - The network’s consensus mechanism

- **ARTChain Main Chain Layer-2 Network Facilities**
  - Primary goal: address the blockchain “impossible trinity” by increasing TPS without sacrificing decentralization and security
  - Avoid high fees caused by main-chain congestion and prevent users from being “crowded out”
  - Lower fees by processing transactions outside Layer-1
  - Support access for multi-scenario ecosystem applications

- **ARTChain Stablecoin Network Infrastructure**
  - Support building the stablecoin network through upgrades and structured coordination of the Layer-1 and Layer-2 network layers

## Cryptographic Security

Blockchain technology has strong security properties that comprehensively protect user data and transaction details. Encryption remains effective throughout the entire data transmission process, significantly reducing the risk of information leakage.

Assets can be tokenized via the ERC-3643 standard, ensuring that tokens corresponding to physical assets are unique (non-duplicable) and verifiable. Users can verify token authenticity and validity at any time, laying a solid foundation for managing tokenized asset circulation and ensuring security and reliability during tokenized flows.

## Decentralized Oversight of Assets

To effectively safeguard the integrity and security of physical cultural relics and artworks, the ArtStar community will actively engage independent professionals with international standing. These professionals will conduct regular independent oversight reviews of physical assets provided by the relevant Hong Kong limited companies. Upon completion, review results will be promptly disclosed to the public to ensure transparency and fairness, enabling all parties to stay informed of the true status of the physical assets.
